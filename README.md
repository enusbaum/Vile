# Vile
Vile is a DOS Text Based RPG I wrote in High School

The game itself is a wholesale clone of classic BBS Text Based RPG's such as MajorMUD, Tele-Arena, LORD, etc.

I wrote it using a shareware BASIC compiler called [ASIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASIC_programming_language) which I probably downloaded from some random BBS. 

I found this code on a random disk while going through my mothers garage, so I'm uploading to GitHub to be enshrined on the internets forever.
